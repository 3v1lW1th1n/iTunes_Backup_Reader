## Updates in version 2.1
* Parses binary FRPD files to get the last connected computer names and usernames on the computer
* Sometimes when apps are sideloaded, they don't appear in "Applications", which has most the interesting data, but only in "Installed Applications" which only contains app's full name. Script now makes sure it gets those potentially sideloaded apps

## Updates in version 2.0
* Added support for recreating the file structure completely on unencrypted backups
* Added field for each installed application if they were possibly sideloaded
* More verbose logging
* Better exception handling
* Better KAPE implementation by separating backups into folders based on users
  
# Future Updates
* Add support for KAPE on version 3.0
* Figure out how to decrypt Manifest.db with user known password
* General code refactoring and optimizations
* Need larger datasets to be tested on
