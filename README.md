# iTunes_Backup_Analyzer
Python 3 Script to parse out iTunes backups

Download binary from the Releases section: https://github.com/jfarley248/iTunes_Backup_Analyzer/releases

*Current Version: 2.1.1*
## Updates in version 2.1
* Parses binary FRPD files to get the last connected computer names and usernames on the computer
* Sometimes when apps are sideloaded, they don't appear in "Applications", which has most the interesting data, but only in "Installed Applications" which only contains app's full name. Script now makes sure it gets those potentially sideloaded apps

## Updates in version 2.0
* Added support for recreating the file structure completely on unencrypted backups
* Added field for each installed application if they were possibly sideloaded
* More verbose logging
* Better exception handling
* Better KAPE implementation by separating backups into folders based on users

Backups located in C:\Users\{user}\AppData\Roaming\Apple Computer\MobileSync\Backup\{GUID}

Usage:
```
usage: iTunes_Backup_Analyzer.exe [-h] -i INPUTDIR [INPUTDIR ...]
                                  [-o OUTPUTDIR [OUTPUTDIR ...]] [-v] [-K]
                                  [-R]

  -o OUTPUTDIR [OUTPUTDIR ...], --outputDir OUTPUTDIR [OUTPUTDIR ...]
                        Directory to store results
  -v, --verbose         increase output verbosity
  -K, --kape            Flag for KAPE Tool, don't use
